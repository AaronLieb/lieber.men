# The Blog Begins

Welcome to the alieb log

I think I'm gonna start writing more, so I stole some static file generation
[code](https://github.com/diamondburned/gomblog) from my friend
[diamond](https://github.com/diamondburned)

I've been thinking about participating in more CTFs, so I'll try to put all my
writeups here as well. 

I'll also be writing some future posts on motiviation, and my experiences at CSUF.

Anyways, thats all.
